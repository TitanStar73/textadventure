Text Adventure game, always adding updates :)

Chapter 1 completed!

# How to Play
Run the main.py script, no dependencies :)

The other files are archival or just test files. You only will need the main.py file OR the built main.exe file (to come in the future)

Set in a Mythical Kingdom, somewhere, sometime
> You wake up in the clearing of a forest, not remembering how you got here. You don't remember anything or anyone. The only thing you remember is a single word: your name.

Remember, nothing is as it seems. There are hundreds of choices and combinations and tons of minigames
