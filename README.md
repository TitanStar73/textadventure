# Mythopes - Console Edition

always adding updates :)

Chapter 1 completed!

# How to Play
 You have two options
 - Run the main.py script, no dependencies :)
 - Run the main.exe (windows only)

The other files are archival or just test files.

Keep in mind, when you enable autosave, it saves to `game.data` and will overwrite a pre-existing file with that name.

# Story

Set in a Mythical Kingdom, somewhere, sometime
> You wake up in the clearing of a forest, not remembering how you got here. You don't remember anything or anyone. The only thing you remember is a single word: your name.

Remember, nothing is as it seems. There are hundreds of choices and combinations and tons of minigames
